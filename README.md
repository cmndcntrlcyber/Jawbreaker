# Jawbreaker: Something for defenders to chew on for a while
## Description
Jawbreaker is serverless C2 & payload delivery system for Red Teams and APT Emulation. This is to be written to be deployed using a combination of GitLab Runners, Cloudflare Workers, with a Web App interface all written in pure Rust. Initial access will spawn a child process from the victim browser to run the rest of the delivery-workers, from there it's all automated until you get to the target device, delivering designed impact all along the way.
