 Robin Hood Bucket
 "If an inssertion collides with an existing element, and that element's "probe distance" (how far away the element is from its ideal location) is higher than how far we've already robed, swap the elements,"
 "Robin Hood Hashing leads to a new search algorithm which requires less than 2.6 probes on average to perform a successful search even when the table is nearly full. Unsuccessful searches require only 0(ln n) probes."

Important Libraries
 Hashmap standard library
 Associative Array Library for Rust
implemented with linear probing Robin Hood Bucket
 HashMap::insert
 HashMap::reserve
 HashMap::resize
 HashMap::insert_hashed_ordered
 RawTable owns its data via
 RawTable::raw_bucket_at
 Naive_hashmap
 naive_hashmap::insert
 naive_hashmap::lookup
 Add the two code snippets naive_hasmap/src/lib.rs
 Key difference between HashMap & naive_hashmap is the use of Vec w/o Option wrapper
 Not implementing delete operaiton, no eed for Option
 Relying solely on Vec::remove
 HashMap paramaterized on RandomState, the hasher is swappable via HashMap::with_hasher
